# allstar-arn
Tool for playing Amateur Radio News on Allstarlink Nodes

# Pre-requisites
This script uses standard Python libraries. Allstar.org ASL
should have them all installed by default. For HamVOIP Allstar
the HTTP requests module must be installed with `pacman -S extra/python-requests`.

# Installation

1. cp allstar-play-arn /usr/local/bin
2. cp arn-5m.ul /etc/asterisk/local
3. Add the commands in rpt.conf from this repository into
/etc/asterisk/rpt.conf in the right stanza and restart Allstar
4. Add the crontab entries from crontab.example into root's
contrab - i.e. crontab -e

# Use

Basic use is either immediately from the command line:

	allstar-play-arn --node 1999

or called from a crontab:

	0 8 * * * allstar-play-arn --node 1999

Depending on the processing speed of the device and Internet connectivity, 
the start of playback may take a significant time. If the desire is for 
precision on the start time, use the `--when` command and execute
`allstar-play-arn` a few minutes before the desired start time.

The script is silent except on errors like all good Unix utilities. Some 
useful troubleshooting may be done with the `--debug` option if an
error is not revealing.

There are not many options to this tool. From /usr/local/bin/allstar-play-arn --help
